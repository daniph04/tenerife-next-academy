### United States 🇺🇸
- High school → NCAA soccer  
- NCAA → MLS Draft  
- MLS Draft → Pro contract + development  

The U.S. pathway prioritizes academics alongside competition. Foreign tours every four years offer a rare window to train like pros and test against new styles.

### Europe 🇪🇸🇬🇧🇮🇹🇫🇷
- Youth academies → B teams  
- B teams → First Division  
- First Division → Global exposure  

European academies push competitive minutes earlier and embed players in a deep football culture.

### How TNA helps
